# DATA WRANGLING AND COMBINING TWO DATASETS IN PYTHON

## Description
In this project, I will apply the skills to gather and wrangle real-world data with two datasets. 

We will retrieve and extract the data, assess the data programmatically and visually, across elements of data quality and structure, and implement a cleaning strategy for the data. We will then store the updated data in our selected database/data store, combine the data, and answer a research question with the datasets.

Throughout the process, I will:
Explain the decisions regarding methods used for gathering, assessing, cleaning, storing, and answering the research question. Finally, plot some visualizations to display the data. 

### What to Expect...
- Loading two different datasets using two different methods
- Analyzing the datasets for quality and tidiness issues (such as missing data, column structure, column data types etc)
= Dealing with the quality and tidiness issues
